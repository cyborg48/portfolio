  category:"writing",
  subcategories:["sub1", "sub2", "sub3"],
  content:"<b>1.1:</b>  The first derivative of displacement is <b>velocity</b>. Or: the change in displacement of an object per unit time. The equation you’ve scrawled onto the whiteboard, v=x/t, when she walks into your classroom late and plops herself down in the back. You know it’s her the moment she walks in with her barrettes and blue hair, the only name on your attendance list without a check scratched beside it, the only name that reached from the roster and slapped you in the cheek when you saw it for the first time, the only name you repeated to yourself along with a prayer that this would all be a joke. That she wouldn’t, in fact, be in your third period class next semester, that someone in administration had made a mistake.<br>Yet, for her sake, you pretend not to know who she is.<br>\"Miss,\" you say. \"Welcome to Honors Physics. Did you check the seating chart before claiming your spot?\"<br>She grunts in what you assume to be a \"no\" and you stick on a false smile.<br>\"Well. Do tell me your name, dear.\"<br>She doesn’t respond, so you’re forced to say it out loud. It tastes like acid. Like the salt on your tongue seven years ago as your tears streamed down your face. Like the sobs in your throat when your doctor sentenced your daughter to die. \"Rosalind Giles?\" you ask, and she nods. \"The seating chart has you right where you are, actually.\"<br>\"Good,\" she snorts. She doesn’t speak for the entirety of your class and you scratch a bitter \"tardy\" beside her name.<br><br><b>1.2:</b> The second derivative of displacement is <b>acceleration.</b> Or: the hum of your Honda as you press your foot against the pedal, backing out of the school parking lot after a long day. Students still loiter on campus, earbuds drooping beneath canvas hoods, backpacks slumped against sagging spines.<br>	As you back out, you catch an unmistakable flash of cyan hair slouching against the school’s burgundy bricks. Rosalind Giles lifts a cigarette to her lips and exhales. You sense the smoke curling against the lungs your daughter should have had.<br>	Your fingers clench against your steering wheel. For a brief second, you make eye contact, her steel irises meeting yours, and then you turn away. Swerve out of the parking lot. You don’t realize you’re shaking until you’re on the highway.<br>	<i>I’m sorry,</i> your doctor’s voice echoes in your ear. You still remember his somber tone, his regretful grimace. <i>There was only one transplant available, and it’s already been claimed. The Giles family, from Pennsylvania. They need it to treat their daughter Rosalind.</i><br>A howl rattles inside your throat but you manage to keep it in.<br>	When Rosalind turns in her next quiz, you scrutinize her work with the eyes of a thousand eagles hunting for prey. When she complains of losing three points on number six while Jonathan, who made the same mistake, lost two, you stifle her with a tart \"you didn’t show enough work\" and leave her steaming in her seat. When she presents her momentum project, you note the tangles entwined in her hair and subtract a point and a half. When she asks why, you tell her that she hadn’t dressed the part. \"Elizabeth wore ripped jeans and a tank top and you still gave her a hundred percent,\" Rosalind protests, and you sigh and return half a mark just to shut her up.<br>	\"I swear,\" you catch her cursing in the hallways, \"she wants me dead. I don’t know why, but from the moment I walked into the room, she decided she wanted me dead.\"<br>	When you sit down to grade her lab report, you slash her rubric with scarlet, like  bloodstains against the pristine white page. Dock a point here for improper formatting. Dock a point there for insufficient significant figures. Your writing becomes a frenzy of \"unacceptable,\" \"no credit,\" and \"see me after class\" and after ten minutes you are panting, lungs heaving in your chest like a warrior after slaughter though you haven’t left your seat since you started.<br>	You survey the battlefield, the bloodbath, the carnage staining the rubric, and deflate. Curling your fingers into a fist, you crumple the paper into a tightly-packed cannonball that you launch into your wastebasket. <i>She wants me dead,</i> Rosalind’s voice spits in your ear and you put your head down, retrieving a fresh rubric to start anew.<br>	You return her paper with a 46 out of 50. \"Well done,\" you’ve scrawled on top. You can’t tell who is more surprised, Rosalind or yourself.<br><br><b>1.3:</b> The third derivative of displacement is <b>jerk.</b> Or: the way your heartbeat screeches to a stop after hearing the rumors. The way you stumble over your own steps when instead of her snark you sense speculations spreading behind cupped hands. \"I heard Rosalind Giles was planning to cut class today.\" \"I heard Rosalind was crazy drunk last night and just called in sick.\" And worst of all, \"I heard Rosalind tried to hang herself in the girl’s bathroom on the third floor. I heard she’s still there, crying her eyes out on the ground.\"<br>	Your pulse surges and before you can blink, you drop your pen and start running towards the door, yanking it open and dashing into the hallway. You kick off your heels. Bunch your skirt in your fist and leap up the stairs three at a time, praying to God that you aren’t too late. The school walls suddenly feel so sterile, closing in on you like the day you dashed through the ICU to witness your baby girl’s final breaths. You’d hollered and howled and held her until her chest became still and her skin became cold and your child became a doll in your hands. And somewhere on the other side of the Mason-Dixon line, a girl named Rosalind Giles took her first breath with her new lungs.<br>	Somewhere in an alternate universe, your daughter grows up to turn seventeen whereas Rosalind does not. But you do not live in that universe. You live in the one where Rosalind Giles kneels in a pool of her own tears, a scarf tied in a deliberate loop hanging limp across her arms as she contemplates her own death in the dark, damp bathroom upstairs. The one where you burst through the doorway and fall to your knees and hold her like she was your own daughter, whispering her name and begging her to respond. The one where she freezes and then falls limp in your arms, curling against your chest as if you were her mother. The one where you murmur, over and over and over as both of you weep, \"I’m sorry. Rosalind, I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry.\"<br><br><b>1.4:</b> The fourth derivative of displacement is <b>jounce.</b> The fifth derivative is <b>crackle.</b> The sixth derivative is <b>pop.</b> The seventh, eighth, and ninth derivatives are <b>lock, drop, </b>and <b>shot</b> — and beyond?<br>At some point the slopes become so small that even the scientists have stopped searching. At some point the change becomes so trivial that it has no application to us; or at least, no application known to mankind. But somewhere, somewhere out there, an instantaneous value wavers oh so infinitesimally but is lost in the equation of everything.<br>You don’t return to your classroom that day. You spend it with Rosalind, first in the counseling office, then outside in your car where you break down and explain everything. Why you resented her from the moment she walked in, why you lowered her grades and shot her silent glares throughout class and why, finally, you burst into the bathroom that day. But no amount of why, why, and why can justify how you behaved. Eventually you fall silent. You know she’s forgiven you. You know you don’t deserve it.<br>Rosalind doesn’t come to class the next day. Or the next. Her desk remains empty for the next month and a half and all you can do is pray.<br>When she returns at last, she carries her textbook in her arms. She approaches your desk before class starts and shoots you a shy smile, one that launches you nearly to tears, and glances at the photograph at the corner of your desk. A beaming girl who could have been her until fate tied the knot on their lives.<br>\"What did I miss while I was gone?\" she asks, setting her textbook before you.<br>You flip the photograph face-down and open up to the next chapter.<br><br><b>2.0:</b> The first integral of displacement is <b>absement.</b><br>",

	  content:"My best friend and I share a name. It's a pretty cool thing to share with a friend, if I do say so myself; even cooler than sharing, say, a gelato or a favorite class or a secret handshake. What's funny, though, is that she's a girl, and I am not, and yet our name(s) is—are?—not gender neutral. They’re not technically the same, either, but they’re close enough to be synonyms to the untrained ear.<br><br>I met her on our first day Mr. Schultz’s seventh grade history class. We were both new to the school, and knew no one but our shadows when we first walked into the building. While everyone lumped themselves into the cliques and friend groups they’d formed in sixth grade, we were both blank slates; tabulae rasae, Schultz would have said. But I didn’t know that when she first sat down in the seat next to mine. I'd assumed she was one of the Curie Middle School natives and wanted nothing to do with a new kid like me.<br><br>My name was at the top of the roster, as always. I wasn't surprised by that, but what did catch me off guard was the curious look she gave me when Mr. Schultz called out \"Ian Allendez.\"<br><br>\"Here,\" I said. My voice came with the awkward squeak of someone who was used to being asked to repeat himself. Fitting, because Schultz apparently didn’t hear me and called out my name again.<br><br>Halfway through the alphabet, Schultz hesitated, and the girl beside me grimaced in anticipation. That was the moment I knew her name was next on the roster. I felt for her, as someone who'd heard a few too many \"Allen-dizz\"-es the first day.<br><br>\"Y-yen Noo-yin?\"<br><br>\"Yen Nguyen,\" said the girl, lifting her hand confidently in the air. I took a full look at her for the first time—fuschia glasses with a sunny yellow dress that hung over her knees like the tablecloth my mother puts out for special occasions. When she pronounced her name, her tone rolled like a sine wave, up and down. But what struck the most was the way she said \"Yen.\"<br><br>\"Ian?\"<br><br>\"Yes, Yen. Eee-eh-enn, like Ian. Like that guy.\" She sent a sideways glance towards me. \"Rhymes with Nguyen, by the way, if that helps you remember, but I doubt you knew how to pronounce Nguyen in the first place.\”<br><br>\"So, Ian.\"<br><br>\"Yep. But the end goes up like a question, like 'Ian?' Make it sound like you’re confused,\" she joked, “because you probably are.\”<br><br>Later that day I mustered up the courage to sit with her at lunch. I returned home that day hearing the echo of her name in my head—Ian? Ian? Ian?—like my mother asking me a question. I practiced saying it aloud once or twice. It felt weird to say my own name to myself but quickly my brain learned to separate toneless “Ian” with question-marked “Yen.” To this day, she’s never had to correct my pronunciation of her name. <br><br>In ninth grade, though, she stopped insisting that we had to pronounce the tone. People started calling her just plain \“Ian\” and she rolled with it. During our end-of-semester biology presentation I heard her introduce herself in a flat tone for the first time. She dropped the little lilt that used to ornament her name and pronounced it with the flatness of a foreigner; adopted an American accent that weighed down the bird’s wings of her tongue.<br><br>That was two years ago. We’re juniors now, and it’s impossible to believe that we’re the same people we were then. But what hasn’t changed, at least, is our taste in smoothies. Just the other day, I walked with her to the café and we both ordered the same things we would have slurped when we were freshmen. <br><br>When the waitress asked Yen for her name, she hesitated, then replied, “Yen.” I stared at her as the waitress scribbled down her order and sashayed away, light brown curls bouncing as she walked. \“Why did you pronounce it like that?\”<br>\“Like what?\”<br><br>\“With the ‘y’, rhymes like ‘zen.’ Like how it’s spelled.\” Like how teacher after teacher after teacher mispronounced it on the first day. In seventh and eighth grade, she’d correct all of them with the intensity of a solar glare. In freshman year she’d let a fumble slide once or twice but by the start of our junior year, her resolve had dimmed into a battered lightbulb. It could be worse, she told me one day as if to justify her indifference. It’s not like my name is Bich Chi Ho. Mispronouncing that would be something.<br><br>Yen wore grey to school now. Cool grey hoodies and sweatpants, crinkled over her frame like paper fished out of the wastebasket. That day she peered over at me with ratty black locks falling into her tired eyes. She still wore glasses, but they were navy blue and thin as veins over ghost-like skin.\“I don’t know,\” Yen shrugged. \“It’s too much of a hassle to explain why it doesn’t sound like how it’s spelled.  She’s going to forget my name in a minute anyway, right?\”<br><br>\“Yeah. But how can you stand mispronouncing your own name? You would’ve gone berserk over the very idea when you were twelve.\”<br><br>\“I guess I’ve gotten used to it,\” Yen replied. <br><br>\“Ian and Yen?\”<br><br>The waitress returned with our smoothies (strawberry banana for her, mango for me) and set them down on the table. Taking a look at the name scribbled over the label, Yen smirked and rotated the cup for me to see.\“Y-E-N-G,\” she said. \“Will you look at that. They still spelled it wrong.\”<br><br>She laughed, sticking her straw into the lid of her cup to take a sip.",
